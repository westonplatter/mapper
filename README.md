Building Application

* Mapper uses the Eclipse to build the project. It's as simple as that.  
  
  
Installing Application on Emulator  
----------------------------------  
* Mapper can be launched on the Android SDK Emulator following these steps,  
  
<ol>
		<li>Install the Eclipse ADT plugin.</li> 

		<li>Open the 'Android Virtual Device Manager'.</li>  
		
		<li>Create an Android Virtual Device with the Google APIs v.10 OS if none is pressent.</li>  
  
		<li>Start the Google API v.10 device to make sure the Android instance works</li>  
  		
  		<li>Back in Eclipse, select the Mapper project folder and click the 'Run' icon. This will install and start the Mapper application within the Emulator</li>
		  
		<li>If the Android VM does not automatically open the Mapper application, find Mapper in the list of applications and click on it from there.</li>  
</ol>
